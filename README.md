# Card Board Hybrid

Rune Lanes is a small vertical slice for a card game / board game hybrid.

Players control wizards on a radius-3 hex arena. Cards cost mana and wizard action points to summon units or cast spells; units then spend their own action points to move across adjacent hexes and attack neighboring enemies.

## Stack

- Rust backend with Axum
- React frontend with Vite and TypeScript
- Bun for frontend package scripts

## Run

Install frontend dependencies:

```sh
bun install
```

Start the backend:

```sh
bun run dev:backend
```

Start the frontend in another shell:

```sh
bun run dev:frontend
```

The frontend proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:4000`.

## Routes

- `/` opens the match picker. It can create a new match, open a match by ID, or link to `/catalog/`.
- `/match/<match-id>` opens the playable Rune Lanes board for a persisted match.
- `/catalog/` opens the backend-driven starter card catalog.

## Match persistence

The backend creates matches through `POST /api/matches`, loads them through
`GET /api/matches/:matchId`, and applies playable actions through
`POST /api/matches/:matchId/actions`. New matches receive short readable IDs
such as `rl-lx5n2w`, and the full match snapshot is stored in SQLite after
creation and after each successful action.

SQLite data defaults to `data/rune-lanes.sqlite3`, which is ignored by git. Set
`RUNE_LANES_DB_PATH=/path/to/rune-lanes.sqlite3` to use a different database,
including isolated temporary databases for tests or local experiments.

## Checks

```sh
bun run ci:local
```

`bun install` configures Git to run `.githooks/pre-push`, which executes the
same local CI script before a push reaches GitHub. If GitHub Actions cannot run
because of a billing or spending limit, a passing `bun run ci:local` is the
project's local signal that the shared CI workflow would have passed.
